				<h1>My name is Michael and this is my webpage.</h1>
				<h2><img class="inline" src="images/uArrow.png" alt="Up Arrow"> That sentance was size h1. These two are size h2.</h2>
				<h3>This  line is an example of size h3. The next line will be h4.</h3>
				<h4>You have probably noticed that as the h value increases the text size gets smaller.</h4>
				<h5>Of course the h system can do a lot more then just change the size of the text.</h5>
				<h6>With CSS you can make each h use a different font, color, size, postioning or just about anything you want.</h6>

          This is probably a more advanced webpage than was required.<br>But I dont care for the following reasons:
        </p>
    				<ul>
    					<li>This is the third Creighton class that has made me make one of these.</li>
    					<li>The first time I made one of these was a decade ago, not even exaggerating. It was literally 2005.</li>
    					<li>Besides, doing all this helped me remember more of what i needed to know to make a good webpage.</li>
    					<li>Also this has given me a chance to make a new CSS from scratch that I will likely use on many things.</li>

                <h1>This is the third page.</h1>
                <p>Im not really sure what to talk about for this page. So i thought i would explain some of my decisions. 
                	<br> The intructions for this assignment called for 3 'different' html pages and i only made 1 page that contains 3 seperate sections that are treated as pages.<br>This is refered to as a single-page website. I did this for a number of reasons.
                </p>
                <ul>
                 	<li>Primaraly because this style has become more popular recently and I beleive it will continue to become more common so doing this project has helped me learn about it.</li>
                 	<li>Second, this style is interesting and more chalenging, which will help me get the most out of this assignment and class.</li>
                </ul>  
                <p>
                 	While this page is largely lacking in unique CSS and content, I beleive that the 3 pages as a whole as well as the sidebars   have more then enough work and unique CSS for the project.
